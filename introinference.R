## 1. From a sample of 122 college students you find that the average
## number of hours slept each night is 6.83.  Assume the population
## standard deviation is known, sigma = 1.8 hours.

## a. Set up hypotheses to test if the average number of hours slept
## by college students is different from 8; use a significance level
## of alpha = 0.02.

# Null hypothesis: students sleep 8 hours a night.
# Alt hypothesis: students don't sleep 8 hours a night.

## b. Evaluate the above hypothesis test and state your conclusion.

xbar <- 6.83
sigma <- 1.8
n <- 122
alpha <- 0.02
mu <- 8
z <- (xbar - mu)/(sigma/sqrt(n))
pvalue <- 2*(1-pnorm(abs(z)))
return 
## c. Calculate an appropriately matching confidence interval.

## d. Interpret your confidence interval.

## e. Does your hypothesis test conclusion match the conclusion from
## your confidence interval?

## f. How much do we care about the shape of the population
## distribution? Why?


## 2.  Biologists are often interested in population dynamics of
## groups of animals.  Some mathematical models claim that if less
## than half of a population is not producing at least three offspring
## on average, then that group is destined to population decline.
## From a sample of 110 (offspring producing) individuals from the
## Order Carnivora, suppose you found that 58 produced at least 3
## offspring.

## a. Set up hypotheses to test if the Order Carnivora is destined to
## population decline; use a level of significance of alpha = 0.05.

## b. Evaluate the above hypothesis test and state your conclusion.

## c. Calculate an appropriately matching confidence interval.

## d. Interpret your confidence interval.

## e. Does your hypothesis test conclusion match the conclusion from
## your confidence interval?
