## 1. Read in our hospital dataset (creating a data frame):
## head.http://roualdes.us/data/hospital.csv.  Please download the dataset
## manually, put it in a folder specific to this class and call
## read.csv() on the file path.  Hint: ?read.csv

## 2. Using the hospital dataset, calculate each of the statistics
## discussed in class on variables of your choice.
## Hint: library(tidyverse); ?dplyr::summarise

```{r}

```

## 3. Describe each statistic in plain English.

## 4. On average which regions tend to have a larger mean/standard
## deviation of infection_risk?
## Hint, from most recommended, to least:
## library(tidyverse); ?dplyr::group_by

## 5. Make at least one plot of each of the plot types discussed in
## class, using the hospital dataset.  Describe, with full sentences
## and language your grandmother could understand, each plot.
## Hint: see class notes and make sure things that supposed to be
## categorical variables are indeed recognized as factors.

## 6. Make a list (map/dict) containing at least four different types
## of R objects (e.g. boolean, numeric, string, vector, list, data
## frame, matrix).
## Hints: ?list, ?vector, ?matrix, ?data.frame

## 7. What is the difference between these two methods of list
## extraction, [ and [[?
## Hint: ?[[

## 8. Create a vector of length > 1.  Write a function that uses a for
## loop to add 1 to each element.
## Hint: ?c, ?rep

## 9. With your original vector from 7., naively add the integer one
## to the entire vector.
## NB: Check out the following link about vectorization:
## http://www.noamross.net/blog/2014/4/16/vectorization-in-r--why.html

## 10. Sample 100 integers between 0 and 10, and store it in
## a vector.
## Hint: ?base::sample

## 11. Check which values are greater than 7, and store the
## output in a new vector.  Print the new vector.
## Hint: ?>

## 12. Use the vector from 11. to index the original vector from 10.
## Hint: ?[

## 13. Use one line of code to calculate the proportion of values in
## the vector from 10. that are greater than 7.

## 14. Using the dataset hospital, make one of each type of plot --
## for a challenge, try ggplot2::ggplot.

## 15. Check out https://yihui.name/knitr/ for writing up your answers
## to this lab.  Also, see my solutions to Lab 01.
